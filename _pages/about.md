HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Weiting (Steven) Tan! I'm currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University CLSP, advised by Prof. [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/). Previously, I completed my Undergraduate and Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at JHU, Go Hop!

My research interest lies at **machine learning** and **natural language processing**. In particular, I am interested in efficient and scalable representation learning methods for cross-modal applications.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: wtan12 at jhu.edu
